    /// not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to

    /// ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

    /// * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
    ///   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
    ///   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
    ///   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
    /// * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
    ///   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
    ///   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
    ///   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
    /// 
    /// Some examples:
    /// 
    /// * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
    ///   same object must also set `sectionName`.
    /// * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
